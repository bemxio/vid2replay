# vid2replay
A couple of Python scripts to convert osu! video gameplay to a replay (.osr file format).
It's still under development, so don't expect it to work flawlessly now.
Any constructive criticism is highly appreciated! :)

## Requirements
- Python 3.7+
- ffmpeg
- at least 4GB of free space
  (depends on how much frames does a video have)

## Jupyter Notebook
not yet, maybe i'll make it when i will finish the project
