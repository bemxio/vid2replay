# vid2replay
A couple of Python scripts to convert osu! video gameplay to a replay (.osr file format).
It's still under development, so don't expect it to work flawlessly now.
Any constructive criticism is highly appreciated! :)

## Requirements
- Python 3.7+
- ffmpeg
- at least 4GB of free space
  (depends on how much frames does a video have)

## Jupyter Notebook
not yet, maybe i'll make it when i will finish the project 

## Where's v0.1-alpha?
i messed up with tags, i accidentally deleted that release.
if you really want it, it was v0.2 without `print_frame_locations.py`, `optimize_locations.py`
and confidence was 0.425
